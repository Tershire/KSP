basic codes to test kOS and kRPC for Kerbal Space Program (KSP)

KSP (Kerbal Space Program) is a game where the players can build aerospace crafts using various parts.
I like to play this game by writing a code to control my crafts.

- kOS  (Kerbal Operating System)       is a specifically developed language for this reason
- kRPC (Kerbal Remote Procedure Calls) is an interface between KSP and Python and other commonly used languages.

Codes:
- hover_control.py: 
  a code that controls the vehicle altitude using a simple PID loop.

- LnchToCirc.ks:
  a code that automates a rocket flight from the launch to a circular orbit.
